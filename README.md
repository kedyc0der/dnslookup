PHP DNS Lookup script

This project is my first creation on GitHub. I have created myself this tools for my need because I like host tools myself.

It's my first script, don't hesitate to complete it and make it much better.

Simple PHP script to lookup entries of A, AAAA, NS, MX, SOA and TXT records.



Build on Bootstrap.
